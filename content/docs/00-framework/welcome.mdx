# Welcome to ObjectStack

> **Build local-first, full-stack applications that run anywhere.**

ObjectStack is a development platform designed for **data sovereignty** and **technical decoupling**. By separating business logic from technical implementation through standardized protocols, it allows you to write your application once and deploy it on any infrastructure—from a local SQLite file to an enterprise Oracle cluster.

## Why ObjectStack?

### 1. Local-First & Data Sovereignty
Your data belongs to you. ObjectStack applications store data locally by default, ensuring complete control, offline capability, and zero vendor lock-in risk.

### 2. Database Agnostic
**Write once, adapter everywhere.** Don't bind your business logic to a specific database vendor. ObjectStack's protocol layer abstracts the underlying storage, allowing you to migrate freely between MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, and SQL Server.

### 3. Metadata-Driven Development
We separate the *what* from the *how*. You define your Backend (ObjectQL) and Frontend (ObjectUI) using standard JSON protocols, significantly reducing boilerplate code and technical debt.

---

## Core Ecosystem

ObjectStack consists of three integrated engines that work together to form a complete platform:

### 1. ObjectQL (Backend Engine)
**The universal data protocol.**

ObjectQL is a database-agnostic query engine that acts as a translation layer between your app and the database.
- **Unified Query Language**: Use a single JSON-based syntax to query any supported database.
- **Auto-Migration**: Define your schema once, and let the engine handle database table creation and updates.
- **Virtual Indexing**: Built-in performance optimization mechanisms.

### 2. ObjectUI (Frontend Engine)
**The declarative interface protocol.**

ObjectUI allows you to build complex user interfaces using pure JSON descriptions, rendering them into modern React components.
- **Zero-Code UI**: Generate forms, tables, and dashboards without writing frontend implementation code.
- **Responsive by Default**: Adapts automatically to mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts.
- **Themeable**: Switch visual styles instantly without changing structure.

### 3. ObjectOS (Runtime Platform)
**The operating system for your apps.**

ObjectOS connects ObjectQL and ObjectUI into a cohesive runtime environment, handling the essential services every app needs.
- **Identity & Access**: Out-of-the-box RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and field-level security.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extend functionality with a flexible plugin system.
- **Multi-Tenant Ready**: Deploy as a single-user local app or a multi-tenant SaaS platform seamlessly.

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Individual Developers** | Build local tools (Notes, CRM) quickly without setting up servers. |
| **Enterprise IT** | Create unified management systems over heterogeneous legacy databases. |
| **SaaS Startups** | Focus on core business logic while getting multi-tenancy for free. |
| **Low-Code Vendors** | Use ObjectStack as a robust, vendor-neutral underlying engine. |
