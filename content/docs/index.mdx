# ObjectStack Documentation

**ObjectStack** is a full-stack, local-first development platform designed for **data sovereignty** and **technical decoupling**. 

It standardizes the development process using a "Protocol-Driven" architecture, separating business logic from technical implementation.

## Core Products

ObjectStack consists of three integrated engines:

### ObjectQL (Backend)
[ObjectQL](./02-objectql): The universal data protocol. Define your data models once in JSON schema, and run them on any database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.). 

### ObjectUI (Frontend)
[ObjectUI](./03-objectui): The declarative UI engine. Render enterprise-grade interfaces directly from your data protocols without writing repetitive component code.

### ObjectOS (Runtime)
[ObjectOS](./04-objectos): The operating system for your apps. Binds ObjectQL and ObjectUI together with built-in identity management, security, and access control.
