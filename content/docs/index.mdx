# ObjectStack Protocol

**The Standard Protocol for AI Software Generation.**

ObjectStack is a set of open specifications that define how Enterprise Applications should be structured, stored, and rendered using declarative data (JSON/YAML) instead of imperative code.

It transforms the role of a developer from a **Code Writer** (handling boilerplate, wiring, and glue code) to a **System Architect** (defining schemas, rules, and flows).



## Why a New Standard?

We are entering the era of **AI-Generated Software**.
Current frameworks (React, NestJS, Spring Boot) are designed for *humans* to write. They are full of implicit context, complex syntax, and fragile dependencies.

ObjectStack is designed for **AI (and Humans)** to write.
* **Structured:** Business logic is strictly typed metadata, not free-form code.
* **Deterministic:** A Schema always compiles to the exact same SQL and UI.
* **Hallucination-Free:** The Protocol constraints prevent invalid logic.

## The Trinity Architecture

ObjectStack is composed of three decoupled protocols that work together to form a complete Application Kernel.

## The "Protocol-First" Difference

How does developing with ObjectStack compare to the traditional way?

### The Old Way (Code-Driven)
To add a "Status" field to a Project entity, you typically touch 4-5 files:
1.  `ALTER TABLE` (SQL Migration)
2.  `Project.entity.ts` (ORM Definition)
3.  `CreateProject.dto.ts` (API Validation)
4.  `ProjectForm.tsx` (Frontend Component)
5.  `ProjectList.tsx` (Frontend Table)

### The ObjectStack Way (Protocol-Driven)
You edit **1 file**:

```yaml
# objects/project.object.yml
fields:
  status:
    type: select
    options: [planning, active, completed]
    default: planning
    searchable: true

```

* **ObjectQL** automatically migrates the database and updates the API.
* **ObjectUI** automatically renders the Dropdown in the Form and the Badge in the Grid.
* **ObjectOS** automatically enforces the allowed values validation.

## Key Features

* **⚡ Local-First:** Built for the edge. Applications run on a local SQLite database and sync to the cloud in the background. Zero latency, offline-ready.
* **🔒 Security by Design:** RBAC and Field-Level Security are injected into the database query compiler. You cannot "forget" to check permissions.
* **🧩 Enterprise Patterns:** Native support for Master-Detail relationships, Currency math, Workflow State Machines, and Audit Logging.
* **🔌 Database Agnostic:** Switch from SQLite (Dev) to PostgreSQL (Prod) to Oracle (Legacy) without changing a single line of business logic.
