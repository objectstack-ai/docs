### 2. [The Manifesto](./manifesto)
Understanding the "Protocol-Driven" philosophy is key to mastering ObjectStack. Learn why we prioritize **Data Sovereignty** and **Technical Decoupling**.

### 3. [The AI Codex](./ai-codex)
ObjectStack is designed to be AI-native. Learn how to leverage LLMs to generate 80% of your application code using our standardized JSON protocols.
