# The Manifesto

ObjectStack's design follows three core principles that form the foundation of the entire architecture.

## Principle I: Protocol Neutrality

### Definition

The protocol layer must remain technology-neutral, not dependent on any specific implementation technology.

### Core Philosophy

**"Protocol is the standard, implementation is replaceable"**

ObjectStack's protocol layer (ObjectQL, ObjectUI) is purely specification definition, containing no concrete implementation. This means:

- ObjectQL protocol can have multiple implementations (JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.)
- ObjectUI protocol can have multiple renderers (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- Underlying databases can be switched freely (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.)

### Practice Guidelines

**When designing protocols**:
- Use standard JSON Schema format
- Avoid introducing language or framework-specific concepts
- Keep protocols simple and extensible

**When developing implementations**:
- Strictly follow protocol specifications
- Validate protocol compatibility through test suites
- Implementations should be interchangeable without affecting applications

### Example

```json
{
  "type": "query",
  "object": "users",
  "filters": {
    "age": { "$gt": 18 }
  },
  "sort": { "created_at": "desc" },
  "limit": 10
}
```

This ObjectQL query protocol can be:
- Transpiled to MySQL queries by JavaScript implementation
- Transpiled to PostgreSQL queries by Python implementation
- Transpiled to Oracle queries by Java implementation

## Principle II: Mechanism-Implementation Separation

### Definition

Completely separate "what to do" (mechanism) from "how to do it" (implementation).

### Core Philosophy

**"Define behavior, not implementation"**

Developers only need to:
- Define data models (Schema)
- Define interface structure (UI Protocol)
- Define business rules (Validation Rules)

Without worrying about:
- How data is stored
- How interfaces are rendered
- How queries are optimized

### Practice Guidelines

**Schema Definition**:

```json
{
  "object": "orders",
  "fields": {
    "order_id": { "type": "text", "primary": true },
    "customer": { "type": "reference", "ref": "customers" },
    "total": { "type": "number" },
    "status": { "type": "select", "options": ["pending", "completed"] }
  }
}
```

Developers only define the data model, and the system automatically:
- Creates database table structure
- Generates CRUD APIs
- Provides data validation
- Establishes relationship mappings

**UI Definition**:

```json
{
  "type": "page",
  "components": [
    {
      "type": "form",
      "fields": [
        { "name": "customer", "label": "Customer", "type": "select" },
        { "name": "total", "label": "Total", "type": "number" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Developers only define the interface structure, and the system automatically:
- Renders form components
- Handles data binding
- Executes form validation
- Manages state updates

### Benefits

1. **Lower learning curve**: Developers don't need to learn implementation details
2. **Higher development efficiency**: Focus on business logic rather than technical implementation
3. **Enhanced maintainability**: Business logic is independent of technology stack
4. **Easier technology upgrades**: Changing underlying implementation doesn't affect business code

## Principle III: Data Sovereignty Declaration

### Definition

Users have complete control and ownership of their data.

### Core Philosophy

**"Data belongs to users, not platforms"**

ObjectStack adheres to the Local-First philosophy:
- Data is stored locally by default
- Users can choose their own database
- No mandatory cloud service binding
- Supports fully offline data operation

### Practice Guidelines

**Local-First Architecture**:

1. **Standalone Mode**:
   - Use .oos files to store data (based on SQLite)
   - Data completely local, no network required
   - Suitable for personal application scenarios

2. **Self-Hosted Mode**:
   - Deploy to enterprise's own servers
   - Use enterprise's existing databases (MySQL, Oracle, etc.)
   - Enterprise has complete data control

3. **Hybrid Mode**:
   - Local-first with optional cloud sync
   - Supports end-to-end encryption
   - Users can export data anytime

### Data Migration Freedom

**Zero-Friction Migration**:

```bash
# Migrate from SQLite to MySQL
objectstack migrate --from sqlite://app.oos --to mysql://localhost/mydb

# Migrate from MySQL to PostgreSQL
objectstack migrate --from mysql://... --to postgresql://...
```

Due to protocol layer abstraction, data can freely migrate between different databases without vendor lock-in.

### Privacy Protection

- **Field-level encryption**: Sensitive fields can be encrypted in storage
- **Field-level permissions**: Fine-grained data access control
- **Audit logs**: Complete data access records
- **Data erasure**: Support for complete user data deletion

### Open Source Commitment

- Core protocol layer (ObjectQL, ObjectUI) uses MIT/Apache 2.0 open source license
- Ensures protocol specifications are permanently open
- Community can freely implement compatible engines
- Avoids single vendor control

## Significance of the Manifesto

These three principles are not technical details, but ObjectStack's **core values**:

1. **Protocol Neutrality**: Ensures freedom of technology choice
2. **Mechanism-Implementation Separation**: Ensures development efficiency and maintainability
3. **Data Sovereignty**: Ensures user rights

Features that violate these principles, even if they have short-term benefits, should not be added to ObjectStack.

## Design Decision Examples

### ✅ Compliant Design

**Scenario**: Adding full-text search functionality

**Decision**:
- Define unified full-text search syntax in protocol layer
- Allow different implementations to use different search engines (Elasticsearch, Meilisearch, etc.)
- Users can choose the search solution that suits them

### ❌ Non-Compliant Design

**Scenario**: Adding cloud storage functionality

**Decision**:
- Mandatory use of a specific cloud service provider
- Data must be uploaded to platform servers
- No local storage option provided

**Why it violates**:
- Violates Protocol Neutrality principle (binding to specific provider)
- Violates Data Sovereignty principle (mandatory cloud storage)

## Practice Checklist

When designing new features, ask yourself:

- [ ] Is this feature defined in the protocol layer or implementation layer?
- [ ] Does it depend on specific technology or services?
- [ ] Do users maintain complete control over data?
- [ ] Can it have multiple implementation approaches?
- [ ] Does it increase vendor lock-in risk?

## Summary

ObjectStack's architectural manifesto is not just a technical guide, but a declaration of values. It ensures:

- **Technical Freedom**: Developers can choose the most suitable technology stack
- **Data Freedom**: Users fully own and control their data
- **Evolution Freedom**: System can continuously evolve without breaking compatibility

These principles are what fundamentally distinguish ObjectStack from other platforms.
