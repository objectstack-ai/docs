# Documentation Overview

> "We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us." — Marshall McLuhan

Welcome to the **ObjectStack Documentation**.

The documentation is now organized around the **Three-Layer Enterprise Architecture**:

## Architecture Layers

### [Creator Layer](../creator-layer)
**"Define the World in Your IDE"**

Where developers work—writing code, defining metadata, and building business logic.
* **[SDK Reference](../creator-layer/sdk)**: TypeScript SDK for defining objects and logic
* **[CLI Guide](../creator-layer/cli)**: Command-line tools for development

### [Governance Layer](../governance-layer)
**"Git Repository as Console"**

Where code transforms into deployable artifacts through CI/CD pipelines.
* **[Deployment Patterns](../governance-layer/deployment)**: Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud strategies

### [Execution Layer](../execution-layer)
**"Self-Powered Trinity Engine"**

Where applications run on customer infrastructure.
* **[ObjectQL](../execution-layer/objectql)**: Data engine specifications
* **[ObjectOS](../execution-layer/objectos)**: Runtime and orchestration specifications
* **[ObjectUI](../execution-layer/objectui)**: View engine specifications

## Core Philosophy: Intent over Implementation

The singular axiom driving these specifications is **Intent over Implementation**.

In traditional software engineering, the "Business Intent" is inextricably mixed with "Technical Implementation."
* **Intent:** "Users over 18 can see the 'Wine' category."
* **Implementation:** A Python `if` statement, a SQL `WHERE` clause, or a React conditional render.

ObjectStack separates these completely.

### The Separation of Concerns

| Layer | Responsibility | Format | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intent (The Spec)** | Defines *WHAT* the system is. | JSON / YAML | `visible_on: "user.age >= 18"` |
| **Engine (The Runtime)** | Decides *HOW* to execute it. | Node.js / Go / Rust | Compiles to SQL or hydrates a React Tree. |

By freezing the **Intent** into a standardized Data Protocol, we achieve:
1.  **Portability:** The same logic runs on PostgreSQL, SQLite, or MongoDB.
2.  **Longevity:** The JSON schema you write today will still be valid in 10 years, even if the underlying runtime switches from Node.js to Bun or Rust.
3.  **AI-Nativity:** It is safer and more accurate for an AI to generate a structured JSON intent than to generate imperative code full of side effects.

## Understanding the Framework

To understand how ObjectStack works:

1. **Start with [Concepts](../concepts)**: Understand the philosophy and core values
2. **Read [Enterprise Framework](../concepts/enterprise-framework)**: See the complete three-layer architecture
3. **Explore each layer**: Dive into Creator, Governance, and Execution layers
4. **Reference specifications**: Use as technical reference when building

## Conformance & Terminology

In this documentation, the key words **"MUST"**, **"MUST NOT"**, **"REQUIRED"**, **"SHALL"**, **"SHALL NOT"**, **"SHOULD"**, **"SHOULD NOT"**, **"RECOMMENDED"**, **"MAY"**, and **"OPTIONAL"** are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### Who is this for?

* **✅ Architect:** To understand the capabilities and constraints of the system.
* **✅ Driver Developer:** To implement a new storage backend (e.g., a ClickHouse driver).
* **✅ Platform Engineer:** To integrate ObjectStack into an existing microservices mesh.
* **✅ Developer:** To build enterprise applications using ObjectStack.
* **❌ First-time visitor:** Start with the **[Getting Started](../index)** guide instead.
